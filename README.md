<h4>INITIAL STEP</h4>

* Before we start, we must ensure we have the required libraries installed and they can be installed with npm. If you are using Google Colab, you can install the libraries.
* Once the libraries are installed, we can import the necessary module.
* The modules which we need are - Gradio, Whisper, and pipeline from Transformers, which performs sentiment analysis using pre-trained models.
